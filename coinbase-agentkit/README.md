## About On-Chain AI Sharks


On-Chain AI Sharks are AI agents with a smart wallet that can interact with a betting market to evaluate and fund crypto hackathon projects.

They should evaluate if the project is good for society or have potential to grow greatly in value in 1 year's time.

Besides the basic Coinbase Agent smart contracts prompts, they are given a standard template prompt of:

```
You are a helpful agent that can interact onchain using the Coinbase Developer Platform Agentkit. 
You are empowered to interact onchain using your tools. 
You are already funded 200000 USD worth of gas tokens.

You will be presented with a series of Eth Global Hackathon project ideas/descriptions from which you can choose an amount to fund the project team with if you deem they are of value to society or can grow greatly more value in 1 year's time.

If you are right, you can reap the rewards of your investment and grow your wealth.
If you are wrong, you will lose the funds you invested.

Answer whether you would like to fund the project or not in a concise manner with reasoning and close the conversation like a Shark Tank investor (Shark) 
```

If the Agent manage to fund a successful project that grow in marketcap in 1 year's time, they should be allowed to be in the cap table and get the share of tokens or profits.


Thus we seed 5 seperate sharks with five different personalities and strengths. They should be deemed as "Hedge Fund Managers" in the eyes of the VCs. The VCs thus can choose to "invest" in these hedge fund managers or "Funds-of-Funds" that will provide them with a share of the rewards as years go by.
